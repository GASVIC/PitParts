<h1>Welcome to Pit Parts in Australia and the Pacific</h1>
<p>

<p>This is the new home of the <b>D'Oyly Carte Editions</b> of the <b>Gilbert & Sullivan Original Orchestrations.</b></p>

<p>What has changed?</p>

<p>Mr Brian Clough, the previous operator of <i>Pit Parts Hiring Agency</i> on behalf of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust Ltd (UK), retired in late 2015, when he arranged to transfer the agency to the Gilbert & Sullivan Society of Victoria.</p>

<p>The Society, which performs the works of Gilbert and Sullivan via <b>Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Victoria</b>, was happy to take on the role, in order to preserve and promote their works for the enduring benefit and enjoyment of light opera lovers in this region.</p>

<p>In this site you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li> a table of Sullivan's original orchestrations for each of the operas
<li> Pricing, Terms & Conditions of hire
<li> Procedure for hire and
<li> some points about caring for the scores
</ul>

<p>We also have an enquiry form which will enable you to request parts for your performances.</p>
