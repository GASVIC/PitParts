### Welcome to Pit Parts in the Southern Hemisphere

This is the new home of the **D'Oyly Carte Editions** of the **Gilbert & Sullivan Original Orchestrations.**

### What has changed?

Mr Brian Clough, the previous operator of **Pit Parts Hiring Agency** on behalf of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust Ltd (UK), retired in late 2015, when he arranged to transfer the agency to the Gilbert & Sullivan Society of Victoria.

The Society, which performs the works of Gilbert and Sullivan via **Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Victoria**, was happy to take on the role, in order to preserve and promote their works for the enduring benefit and enjoyment of light opera lovers in this region.
