##Welcome to Pit Parts in Australia and the Pacific

This is the new home of the **D'Oyly Carte Editions** of the **Gilbert & Sullivan Original Orchestrations.**

What has changed?

Mr Brian Clough, the previous operator of **Pit Parts Hiring Agency** on behalf of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust Ltd (UK), retired in late 2015, when he arranged to transfer the agency to the Gilbert & Sullivan Society of Victoria.

The Society, which performs the works of Gilbert and Sullivan via **Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Victoria**, was happy to take on the role, in order to preserve and promote their works for the enduring benefit and enjoyment of light opera lovers in this region.

In this site you will find:

* a table of Sullivan's original orchestrations for each of the operas
* Pricing, Terms & Conditions of hire
* Procedure for hire and
* some points about caring for the scores

We also have an enquiry form which will enable you to request parts for your performances.
