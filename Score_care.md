## Pit Parts - Gilbert & Sullivan Orchestrations

### Score Check Lists

The Conductor or Orchestra Convener is the Responsible Person for the purposes of the Hire Agreement.

1. Two check lists will be enclosed with the Parts. One copy is to be **returned as confirmation of their arrival**, either as a scanned copy by email (preferred) or via Australia Post. 
2. The second copy is to be retained and the Parts checked off at the end of the hire period
3. The check list is to be **included with the Parts when they are returned.** We recommend that you retain a copy of this list in case of any queries.

### Marking of Orchestral Parts

1. Sets will be sent to you in the best possible condition.
2. ** All marks made by the hirer must be removed before returning the music. **
3. Use ONLY soft lead pencils (2B or more) and erase with Staedtler-Mars plastic erasers or equivalent.
4. If deemed necessary by Pit Parts, a cleaning charge (see ADDITIONAL CHARGES) will be levied after inspection of the returned Parts.

### Lost, Mislaid or Damaged Parts

1. The Responsible Person must, at all times, know the whereabouts of the Orchestral Parts
2. The Responsible Person must **ensure that no Part is left in the orchestra pit at the end of each performance.**
3. Should the Responsible Person become aware of any loss or damage of a Part, they should advise Pit Parts immediately
4. Lost, mislaid and damaged Parts will render the hirer liable to the cost of repair or replacement of the Parts, or of the complete set, as the case may be, which entails obtaining imported copies from the D'Oyly Carte Trust UK.
